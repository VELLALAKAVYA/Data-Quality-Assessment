# Data-Quality-Assessment
Data Quality Assessment is the primary step to understand the data </br>
DQA exposes issues with technical and business data that allow the organization to properly plan for data cleansing and enrichment strategies<br/>
Generally data quality assessment is done to maintain quality structure data by identifying missing data and errors in the data field</br>
High quality data is precondition for analyzing and using big data and for guaranteeing the value of the data<br/><br/>
***The aim of a data quality assessment is to identify incorrect data, to estimate the impact on the business processes, and to implement corrective action***

# The challenges of data quality:
  - COMPLETENESS - Are all data sets and data items recorded?
  - UNIQUENESS - Is there a single view of the data set?
  - TIMELINESS - The degree to which data represent reality from the required point in time
  - VALIDITY - Does the data match the rules?
  - ACCURACY  - Does the data reflect the data set?
  - CONSISTENCY  - Can we match the data set across data stores?
 
# Some of the other data quality considerations
  - It is crucial to understand and manage the six core dimensions. However, there are additional factors which can have an impact on the     effective use of data. Even when all six dimensions are deemed to be satisfactory, the data can still fail to achieve the objective
  - Data may be perfectly complete, unique, timely, valid, accurate and timely. However if data items are in English and the users don’t       understand English then it will be useless.
 
> **Usability of the data** - Is it understandable, simple, relevant, accessible, maintainable and at the right level of precision? <br/>
> **Timing issues with the data** (beyond timeliness itself) - Is it stable yet responsive to legitimate change requests?<br/>
> **Flexibility of the data** - Is it comparable and compatible with other data, does it have useful groupingsand classifications? <br/>
> **Confidence in the data** - Are Data Governance, Data Protection and Data Security in place? What is the reputation of the data, and is                                it verified or verifiable? <br/>
> **Value of the data** - Is there a good cost/benefit case for the data? Is it being optimally used?
                        Does it endanger people’s safety or privacy or the legal responsibilities of the enterprise?
                        Does it support or contradict the corporate image or the corporate message?<br/>
